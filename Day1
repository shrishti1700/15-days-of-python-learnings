#Day-1 
#Topic - Python syntax, variables, data types, and basic operations
#To do- Practise 10 codes for above topic

#syntax - structure or rules of a programming language
print("Day 1, Let's do great and practise consistently!")

#Variables - to store data in a program.It can be in form numbers, strings, or other objects
x = 17
y = "Birthdate"
print(x)
print(y)

#String Methods: 
Split: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. 
Join: Joins elements of a list into a single string, with a specified separator between elements. 
Find: Returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string. Returns -1 if not found. 
Count: Returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in the string.

#String Operators: 
Concatenation: Joins two or more strings end-to-end.
Repetition: Repeats the string a specified number of times. 
Indexing: Accesses a character at a specified index in the string. 
Slicing: Extracts a substring from the string using a range of indices.

#String Formatting:
Using f-strings (Python 3.6+): Embeds expressions inside string literals, 
using curly braces {}. Using format method: Inserts values into placeholders defined by curly braces {} in the string. 
Using % operator: Performs string formatting by embedding values in a string using % followed by a format specifier.
