#Day-2
# Ten practice codes to help understand and practice looping in Python

#1. Basic for Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

#2.Loop Through a List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "mango"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

#3.Loop Through a String
for char in "Mobile Phone":
    print(char)

#4.Loop with break - Break out of the loop when a condition is met
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

#5.Loop with continue - Skip the current iteration when a condition is met
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    print(i)

#6.Nested Loops
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

#7.Loop Through a Dictionary
person = {"name": "Shrishti", "age": 25, "city": "Gurgoan"}
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

#8.Loop with while - Loop while a condition is true
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

#9.Enumerate in a Loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry","mango"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

#10.List Comprehension with Loop:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

##Good work today!!
